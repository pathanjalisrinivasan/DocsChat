# RAG System with DeepSeek

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using DeepSeek, a powerful language model, to answer questions based on user-uploaded documents. The system also includes a fallback mechanism to perform web searches when the documents do not contain relevant information. The frontend is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

## Features

• Extracted text from user-uploaded PDFs directly and converted them into Document objects for indexing.
• Used Qdrant, a high-performance vector search engine to store and retrieve document embeddings generated by a local Hugging Face model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5).
• Retrieved relevant documents from the vector store and used DeepSeek (via Ollama) to generate context-aware responses to user queries.
• Utilized Firecrawl to scrape and summarize web content when no relevant answer was found in the documents, passing it to DeepSeek for response generation.
