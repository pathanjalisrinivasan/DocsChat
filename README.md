# RAG System with DeepSeek

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using DeepSeek, a powerful language model, to answer questions based on user-uploaded documents. The system also includes a fallback mechanism to perform web searches when the documents do not contain relevant information. The frontend is built using Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.

## Features

- **Document Processing:** Extract text from user-uploaded PDFs using PyPDF2 and decode other formats directly, converting them into `Document` objects for indexing.
- **Vector Store and Indexing:** Use Qdrant, a high-performance vector search engine, to store and retrieve document embeddings generated by a local HuggingFace model (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`).
- **DeepSeek for Response Generation:** Retrieve relevant documents from the vector store and use DeepSeek (via Ollama) to generate coherent, context-aware responses to user queries.
- **Fallback to Web Search:** If no relevant answer is found in the documents, use Firecrawl to scrape and summarize web content, passing it to DeepSeek for response generation.
- **Handling Timeouts and Errors:** Implement custom timeout logic with threading and retries to manage interactions with external services like Ollama and Firecrawl.
- **Streamlit Frontend:** Build an interactive interface using Streamlit, allowing users to upload documents, ask questions, and view responses with a PDF preview sidebar.
- **DeepSeekâ€™s Role:** DeepSeek is central to understanding user queries, generating responses based on retrieved documents, and summarizing web search results, making it ideal for complex language tasks.
